#def is command that defines a function and the function is written beneath it.
#return replies to the caller function giving it output and ends the function
#the condition within return uses boolean output comparing TRUE or FALSE with == operator and combines the conditions with and/or operators.
#this is basically rewriting the given statement in the problem in mathematical form.
